## Introduction

This Library Management System allows users to manage books, borrow/return books, and track book availability in a digital library. The system is built with a React Native Expo app for the user interface, Firebase for storing book and user data, and a Node.js backend to handle business logic and communication between the app and Firebase.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native** (with Expo) â€“ for building the cross-platform mobile application.
- **Firebase** â€“ for database and authentication services.
- **Node.js** â€“ for building the backend server to manage requests and Firebase communication.
- **Express.js** â€“ for building RESTful APIs in the Node.js backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need the following software installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Expo CLI** (for running React Native app)
- **Firebase Account** (for Firebase configuration)

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Set up **Firebase Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication**.
3. Copy the Firebase config details and paste them into the app to connect to your Firebase instance.



# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
